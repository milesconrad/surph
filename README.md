# surph
A basic top-down endless game made using C++ and the SFML (version 2.6.x) library. The objective is to dodge all of the boulders coming at you from the top of the screen, using the left and right arrow keys. Should run on all systems.

## Download & Compilation
The process is basic, be sure CMake is installed on your system first

Clone with `git clone --recursive` to include the correct version of SFML in the download

Compile with
- `cmake .`
- `make`
  
and the executable + assets will be located in the `build/` directory
