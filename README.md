# surph
A basic top-down endless game made using C++ and the SFML (version 2.6.x) library. The objective is to dodge all of the boulders coming at you from the top of the screen, using the left and right arrow keys. Before compiling, you will make sure your compiler supports POSIX threads.

## Compilation
The process is basic, make sure cmake is installed and run
- `cmake .`
- `make`
and the executable + assets will be located in the `build/` directory
