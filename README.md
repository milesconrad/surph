# surph
A basic top-down endless game made using C++ and the SFML (version 2.6.1-1) library. The objective is to dodge all of the boulders coming at you from the top of the screen, using the left and right arrow keys. The textures were designed by [amara553](https://twitter.com/amara553) on twitter. Before compiling, you will need to install the SFML library and make sure your compiler supports POSIX threads.
