# surph
A basic top-down endless game made using C++ and the SFML (version 2.6.x) library. The objective is to dodge all of the boulders coming at you from the top of the screen, using the left and right arrow keys. Should run on all systems.

## Compilation
The process is basic, be sure CMake is installed on your system and run
- `cmake .`
- `make`
  
and the executable + assets will be located in the `build/` directory
