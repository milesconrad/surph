# surph
A basic top-down endless game made using C++ and the SFML library. The objective is to dodge all of the boulders coming at you from the top of the screen, using the left and right arrow keys. The textures were designed by [ochrecats](https://twitter.com/ochrecats) on twitter. Before compiling, you will need to install the SFML library and make sure your compiler supports POSIX threads.
